            <h4>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was
                        given
                        the
                        nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number
                        of
                        folks
                        that
                        came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also
                        commonly
                        sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the
                        sandy
                        beaches
                        in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                        undammed
                        rivers
                        in
                        the
                        United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early
                        summer
                        and
                        lower,
                        slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with
                        children
                        who
                        like to
                        swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green
                        river
                        flows
                        towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery,
                        and
                        great
                        rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid
                        (just
                        outside
                        Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of
                        prehistoric
                        and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>

                    <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the
                        uniqueness
                        and
                        rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

            <h4>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never
                        forget
                        your
                        visit to the Grand Canyon.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one
                        truly
                        unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater
                        rapids,
                        but
                        with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                        technically
                        rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However,
                        most
                        people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
